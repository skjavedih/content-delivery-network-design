# content-delivery-network-design
Design content delivery network(CDN) with example implementation in Java.

This Java implementation provides a simplified example of a Content Delivery Network. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

1. `Content`: Represents the content stored in the CDN.
2. `OriginServer`: Stores the original content.
3. `EdgeServer`: Caches content and serves it to users in a specific region.
4. `LoadBalancer`: Directs user requests to the nearest edge server.
5. `ContentManager`: Handles content updates and cache invalidation.
6. `ContentDeliveryNetwork`: The main class that ties everything together.

The `main` method demonstrates how to use this CDN implementation:

1. It creates edge servers in different regions.
2. Adds some content to the CDN.
3. Simulates user requests from different regions.
4. Updates the content and shows how the updated content is served.

This example is simplified for clarity and doesn't include many features of a real-world CDN, such as:

- Real network communication
- Advanced load balancing algorithms
- Content compression
- HTTPS support
- Detailed logging and analytics
- Automatic scaling of edge servers
